# : Purchase Behavior & Visitor Demographics

This Code explores how different user profiles (teachers, parents, professionals, etc.) behave on an e-commerce site in terms of page views, purchase timing, and gender distribution.

## 📁 Files

- `aPurchase behaviour.R`: Full code for data wrangling, aggregation, and visualization
- `datasets/ecommerce-data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis
- `screenshots/`: Optional plot images (see below)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Convert categorical page view estimates to integer format
- Summarize total and average behavior per profile
- Calculate proportions for categorical comparisons
- Explore behavior patterns by gender and purchase recency
- Use `aggregate()`, `table()`, `prop.table()`, and `lattice::histogram()`

## 🖼️ Visualizations

| Image | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `histogram_profile_purchasedWhen.png` | Compares when purchases were made across user profiles |
